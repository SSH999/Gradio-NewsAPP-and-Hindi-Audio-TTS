- Up to **10 articles** are retrieved for analysis.
- Each article includes the **title**, **summary**, and **full content** (if available).

### 2 Topic Extraction
- Key topics are identified using the **KeyBERT** library for deeper insights into article content.
- The application compares unique and common topics across extracted articles.

### 3 Sentiment Analysis
- Each article‚Äôs content undergoes sentiment analysis using the **transformers pipeline**.
- Sentiments are classified as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.

### 4 Comparative Analysis
- The app calculates:
  - Total count of Positive, Negative, and Neutral articles.
  - Highlights key differences between Positive and Negative coverage.

### 5 Audio Summary (Hindi TTS)
- The summarized insights are translated into Hindi and converted to speech using **gTTS**.
- The result is saved as an **MP3 file** for easy listening.

### 6 FastAPI Endpoint
- The FastAPI endpoint allows automated data retrieval using:
```
https://your-space-url.hf.space/analyze?company_name=Tesla
```
- The response includes:
  - Extracted articles with sentiment labels
  - Comparative analysis results
  - Downloadable Hindi audio file

### 7 Gradio Interface

## Assumptions & Limitations
- The **NewsAPI** key may require registration for extended usage.  
- The application processes up to **10 articles** at a time for efficiency.  
- Sentiment analysis is based on pre-trained models, which may occasionally misclassify content.  
- The Hindi TTS conversion is optimized for concise summaries and may not perform well with lengthy content.
